# Aeron.jl

Julia wrappers around the [Aeron Client](https://github.com/real-logic/Aeron) C library for reliable UDP unicast, multicast, and shared-memory messaging.

This repository provides LibAeron.jl and Aeron.jl. The former containers bare-bones defintions for accessing the Aeron client C library, while the latter attemps to wrap those definitions in a higher level more Julia-friendly interface.
