These examples show how to send data back and forth between two Julia instances using `aeron`. 

Before running any of these, you will need to run a media driver on your computer. 
Currently you will have look at the `aeron` documentation for how to do this, but hopefully we can bundle the C media driver in a future update.

Lower level examples using LibAeron.jl directly are provided in `examples-libaeron`.
