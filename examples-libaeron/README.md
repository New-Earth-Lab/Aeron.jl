These examples are translations of the examples from [https://github.com/real-logic/aeron/blob/master/aeron-samples/src/main/c/](https://github.com/real-logic/aeron/blob/master/aeron-samples/src/main/c/ ).

They illustrate how to call `aeron` from Julia with complete configurability using LibAeron.jl

Higher level Julia examples are in the `examples` folder.
